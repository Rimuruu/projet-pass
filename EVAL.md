# Bug

- I didn't succeed to make the project playable on two different machine on the same network. I enable port forwarding on my router but it didn't work. The project works on the same machine with the loopback adresse or the local ip adress.

# Evolution

- Replay possibility with the same players.
- Possibility for a player to reconnect during a game when he lost connection.
